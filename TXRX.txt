About TXRX (data link protocol)

1. bit encoding [xOn(), xOff(), rcvr()]

The transmitter uses a simple AM scheme where on means 1 and off means 0. Timing information is not transmitted in the signal and must be defined in the protocol. Current specs are:

Baud rate = 100 bit/s (incl. overhead)
1/0 transition value = 20

2. byte encoding [tByte(), rByte()]

The transmitter modulates the 15khz carrier by a RS232-like signal. That means it's...
- High when idle
- Has one low start bit
- Sends the data LSB first
- Has one high stop bit
The transmitter actually transmits 2 stop bits and this has no effect on the receiver but it may be changed to just 1.

3. data encoding [tData(), rData()]

Each data transmission consists of 3 bytes:
1: start byte (0xff)
2: data byte
3: CRC8 checksum

0xff is a good value for start byte because if the start bit of the start byte is missed the stream of 1's will act as a "NOP slide" instead of throwing the system off sync.

The overall overhead is ~300%. That means for each 8 bits of data, ~32 bits must be transmitted.
